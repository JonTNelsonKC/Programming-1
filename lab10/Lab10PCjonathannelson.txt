Array named userNumbersArray with 20 integer data members

For (I=0; I < 20; I++)
	{Print “Enter in 20 numbers between 0 and 101
	 User inputs a number
	 do{
	 	if(number is between 0 and 101){
			if(number isn’t a duplicate){
			assign number to n[i]
			}
		}
		else{
			Print “Number not between 0 and 101, enter a different number”
	while(number >= 101) && (number <= 0)
Sort userNumbersArray from least to greatest
Print all the elements of userNumbersArray (which would now be in numerical order).
